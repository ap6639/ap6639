Hey everyone. My name is Aryan Patel. I am 18 years old. I came from Long Island, Herricks High School. I would say my favorite food is Pizza or pasta. I know thats very basic haha. I am majoring in Software Engineering, because I really enjoy coding so far. Some of my hobbies are listening to music, playing football and basketball, eating random foods, going on vacations, hanging out with friends and family. My favorite music is rap and I would say my favorite artist is juice world or trippie red. Yeah I know I'm basic LOL. Well, that's pretty much the main information about me. Thanks for listening!
